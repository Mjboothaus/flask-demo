Create your own Flask app on Heroku that accepts a stock ticker input from the user and
plots closing price data for the last month. The Quandle WIKI dataset provides this data for free,
and you can use Python's Requests library along with simplejson to access it in Python via API.
You can analyze the data using pandas and plot using Bokeh.
By the end you should have some kind of interactive visualization viewable from the Internet.

--------------

Step 1: Get data from API and put it in pandas

Use the requests library to grab some data from a public API.
This will often be in JSON format, in which case simplejson will be useful.

Build in some interactivity by having the user submit a form which determines which data is requested.
Create a pandas dataframe with the data.

Step 2: Use Bokeh to plot pandas data

Create a Bokeh plot from the dataframe.

Make the plot visible on your website through embedded HTML or other methods -
this is where Flask comes in to manage the interactivity and display the desired content.

Initial instructions

# Flask on Heroku

This project is intended to help you tie together some important concepts and
technologies from the 12-day course, including Git, Flask, JSON, Pandas,
Requests, Heroku, and Bokeh for visualization.

The repository contains a basic template for a Flask configuration that will
work on Heroku.

A [finished example](https://lemurian.herokuapp.com) that demonstrates some basic functionality.

## Step 1: Setup and deploy
- Git clone the existing template repository.
- `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, `conda-requirements.txt`, and `runtime.txt`
  contain some default settings.
- There is some boilerplate HTML in `templates/`
- Create Heroku application with `heroku create <app_name>` or leave blank to
  auto-generate a name.
- (Suggested) Use the [conda buildpack](https://github.com/kennethreitz/conda-buildpack).
  If you choose not to, put all requirements into `requirements.txt`

  `heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/kennethreitz/conda-buildpack.git`

  The advantages of conda include easier virtual environment management and fast package installation from binaries (as compared to the compilation that pip-installed packages sometimes require).
  One disadvantage is that binaries take up a lot of memory, and the slug pushed to Heroku is limited to 300 MB. Another note is that the conda buildpack is being deprecated in favor of a Docker solution.
- Deploy to Heroku: `git push heroku master`
- You should be able to see your site at `https://<app_name>.herokuapp.com`
- A useful reference is the Heroku [quickstart guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python-o).

## Step 2: Get data from API and put it in pandas
- Use the `requests` library to grab some data from a public API. This will
  often be in JSON format, in which case `simplejson` will be useful.
- Build in some interactivity by having the user submit a form which determines which data is requested.
- Create a `pandas` dataframe with the data.

## Step 3: Use Bokeh to plot pandas data
- Create a Bokeh plot from the dataframe.
- Consult the Bokeh [documentation](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html)
  and [examples](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/master/examples/embed).
- Make the plot visible on your website through embedded HTML or other methods - this is where Flask comes in to manage the interactivity and display the desired content.
- Some good references for Flask: [This article](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-web-applications-with-flask-part-i/), especially the links in "Starting off", and [this tutorial](https://github.com/bev-a-tron/MyFlaskTutorial).
