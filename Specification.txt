Create your own Flask app on Heroku that accepts a stock ticker input from the user and
plots closing price data for the last month. The Quandle WIKI dataset provides this data for free,
and you can use Python's Requests library along with simplejson to access it in Python via API.
You can analyze the data using pandas and plot using Bokeh.
By the end you should have some kind of interactive visualization viewable from the Internet.

--------------

Step 1: Get data from API and put it in pandas

Use the requests library to grab some data from a public API.
This will often be in JSON format, in which case simplejson will be useful.

Build in some interactivity by having the user submit a form which determines which data is requested.
Create a pandas dataframe with the data.

Step 2: Use Bokeh to plot pandas data

Create a Bokeh plot from the dataframe.

Make the plot visible on your website through embedded HTML or other methods -
this is where Flask comes in to manage the interactivity and display the desired content.
